INTRODUCTION
------------
This custom REDCap hook registry allows independent functions, which implement
a given REDCap hook, to be defined and executed outside of a single, monolithic
hook file.

NOTE: View ticket #3322 for more details.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Currently there are no requirements other than REDCap. 


INSTALLATION
------------
To install this code:
 1. Clone the hook registry code from (remote repository location can be found 
    in ticket #3322) into <redcap root directory>/hooks.
 2. Login to REDCap with a user which has administrator priviledges, and
    associate the absolute path of <redcap root directory>/hooks/hooks.php
    with the  REDCap Hooks field in the General Configuration located in the
    Control Center.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
This code relies upon an ini configuration file which defines the hook type /
PHP include file path / hook implementation function relationship (file path
defined above as HOOKS_CONFIG).

Config Example:

[redcap_hook_function]
redcap/root/relative/path/to/hook/file.php= name_of_hook_function:<pid>,<pid>

It is recommended that hook implementations that are project specific be placed
in a file named for the project and placed in
<redcap-root>/hooks/projects/<project-string>.  Hook functions should have the
same form as the original REDCap hook function name with the leading
'redcap_' replaced with <project-string>. For example, the 'test' project
implements the redcap_save_record hook.  The hook function should be named
test_save_record and should be located in <redcap-root>/hooks/projects/test.php.

Hook implementations that are plugin specific should be placed in a hook file
within the <plugin-root> directory.  Hook functions should have the same form as
the original REDCap hook function names with the leading 'redcap_' replaced with
<plugin-root>. For example, the 'example' plugin implements the 
redcap_save_record hook.  The hook function should be named example_save_record
and should be located in <redcap-root>/plugins/<plugin-root>/hooks.php.

NOTE: An unavoidable limitation is that all hook functions must be uniquely
named.


TESTING
-------
Todo!


VALIDATION
----------
To validate that the hook registry is working correctly validate that a hook
implementation, which uses this code works correctly (e.g. the notification
plugin).
