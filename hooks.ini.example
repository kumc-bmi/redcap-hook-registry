;This configuration file defines the relatinship between REDCap hook types, PHP
;files containing hook implementations, hook implementation functions, and
;REDCap projects which use the given implementation.

;The format for defining this relationship is as follows:
;[redcap_hook_function]
;redcap/root/relative/path/to/hook/file.php= hook_implementation:<pid>,<pid>...

;This is an example only.
;[redcap_save_record]
;hooks/projects/example.php= example_save_record:1,2

;Instead of declaring individual project ids a hook implementation can be
;enabled for all projects using *.
;hooks/projects/example.php= example_save_record:*
